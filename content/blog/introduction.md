I am a code+design enthusiast; and I’m sure since you’re reading this, you’re one as well. I’m an avid reader as well, and for obvious reasons, I’m going to go ahead and assume you’re one too.

I’ve been reading articles on the internet for a decade now, and I know the annoyance one feels when the article they’re presented with, is just a place-holder with more than 70% of padding. The noise- is too much; is increasing.

Hence, I assembled a team of like-minded individuals in order to create a product that would help not only ourselves, but the community in its entirety by separating the signal from the noise, that is, presenting the most qualitative articles onto a unified, centralized interface.

Our mission was to create a publication that would aggregate posts from all around the blogosphere (yes, we have eyes everywhere. No, we won’t redirect you to nsa.gov) and serve them in one place. During development, we realised having a weekly podcast (every Wednesday, tentatively) and a weekly newsletter that curates and explains the aggregation (achieved in the week preceding the podcast/newsletter) would add to the concept as well.

The first step was to detail an Editorial Guidelines draft, deciding on a platform and assembling a team. The next step was to install all dependencies required by the platform and the team (mostly coffee and some rubber ducks here) and to get a legible design live.

Now that we have all of our documents, pages, mugs and ducks ready, the final step is to acquire as much feedback from the community of fellow enthusiasts and hackers as possible. Hence, the reason you’re reading this article. Our platform, in the form of a publication, is 90% ready. The only way we can achieve the extra 10% we need is through feedback from all of you.

So tell me, fellow coders and designers, would you be interested in such a product? Would you back said product? Would you like to see us grow and become the #1 place for qualitative content discovery? Would you agree that our motto of “Quality > Quantity” should be upheld? Let us know, we’re open to all forms of suggestions!
