<h2 id="2-changes-to-the-agreements">2. Changes to the Agreements</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
  If we make changes to this agreement, we will tell you. If you do not like the changes to the agreement or agreements, you will just have to stop using our services.

</div>


<p>Occasionally we may, in our discretion, make changes to the Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we’ll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within the Service or by sending you an email. In some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued use of the Service after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Please therefore make sure you read any such notice carefully. If you do not wish to continue using the Service under the new version of the Agreements, you may terminate the Agreements by contacting us or using the available controls in the Service account settings.</p>

<h2 id="3-using-chorale">3. Using Chorale</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
  You should read this section yourself, as it is one of the most important in this agreement.

</div>


<h3 id="3-1-our-services-paid-subscriptions">3.1 Our Services &amp; Paid Subscriptions</h3>

<p>Chorale provides streaming services offering a selection of music and other content. Certain Chorale services are provided to you free-of-charge. Other Chorale services require payment before you can access them. The Chorale services that may be accessed after payment are currently referred to as the “Premium Service” and the “Unlimited Service” (together, the “Paid Subscriptions”). The Chorale Service that does not require payment is currently referred to as the “Free Service”. You can learn more about our services by visiting our website.</p>

<p>The Unlimited Service may not be available to all users. We will explain which services are available to you when you are signing up for the services. If you cancel your subscription to the Unlimited Service, or if your subscription to the Unlimited Service is interrupted (for example, if you change your payment details), you may not be able to re-subscribe for the Unlimited Service. Note that the Unlimited Service may be discontinued in the future, in which case you will no longer be charged for the Service.</p>

<h3 id="3-2-trials">3.2 Trials</h3>

<p>From time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of Paid Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”). Chorale reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and without liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.</p>

<p>For some Trials, we’ll require you to provide your payment details to start the Trial. AT THE END OF SUCH TRIALS, WE MAY AUTOMATICALLY START TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION ON THE FIRST DAY FOLLOWING THE END OF THE TRIAL, ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS. BY PROVIDING YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TRIAL, YOU AGREE TO THIS CHARGE USING SUCH PAYMENT DETAILS. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THIS CHARGE, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH YOUR CHORALE ACCOUNT’S SUBSCRIPTION PAGE OR TERMINATE YOUR CHORALE ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL. IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED ON A RECURRING MONTHLY BASIS, YOU MUST CANCEL THE APPLICABLE PAID SUBSCRIPTION THROUGH YOUR CHORALE ACCOUNT’S SUBSCRIPTION PAGE OR TERMINATE YOUR CHORALE ACCOUNT BEFORE THE END OF THE RECURRING MONTHLY PERIOD. PAID SUBSCRIPTIONS CANNOT BE TERMINATED BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD FOR WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS, CHORALE WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY PAID. THE LIMITATION SECTION SETS FORTH ADDITIONAL TERMS REGARDING CANCELLATION OF YOUR PAID SUBSCRIPTION.</p>

<h2 id="4-rights-we-grant-you">4. Rights We Grant You</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
  You agree to abide by our User Guidelines and not to use the Chorale Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements.

</div>


<p>The Chorale Service and the Content are the property of Chorale or Chorale&rsquo;s licensors. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable licence to make use of the Chorale Service, and a limited, non-exclusive, revocable licence to make personal, non-commercial, entertainment use of the Content (the “Licence”). This Licence shall remain in effect until and unless terminated by you or Chorale. You promise and agree that you are using the Content for your own personal, non-commercial, entertainment use and that you will not redistribute or transfer the Chorale Service or the Content.</p>

<p>The Chorale software applications and the Content are licensed, not sold, to you, and Chorale and its licensors retain ownership of all copies of the Chorale software applications and Content even after installation on your personal computers, mobile handsets, tablets, and/or other relevant devices (“Devices”).</p>

<p>All Chorale trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, domain names, and any other features of the Chorale brand (“Chorale Brand Features”) are the sole property of Chorale or its licensors. The Agreements do not grant you any rights to use any Chorale Brand Features whether for commercial or non-commercial use.</p>

<p>You agree to abide by our User Guidelines and not to use the Chorale Service, the Content, or any part thereof in any manner not expressly permitted by the Agreements. Except for the rights expressly granted to you in these Agreements, Chorale grants no right, title, or interest to you in the Chorale Service or Content.</p>

<p>Third party software (for example, open source software libraries) included in the Chorale Service are licensed to you either under the Agreements or under the relevant third party software library’s licence terms as published in the help or settings section of our desktop and mobile client and/or on our website.</p>

<h2 id="5-third-party-applications">5. Third Party Applications</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
  Even if you use third party apps, you still need to agree to this agreement.

</div>


<p>The Chorale Service is integrated with third party applications, websites, and services (“Third Party Applications”) to make available content, products, and/or services to you. These Third Party Applications may have their own terms and conditions of use and privacy policies and your use of these Third Party Applications will be governed by and subject to such terms and conditions and privacy policies. You understand and agree that Chorale does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the behavior, features, or content of any Third Party Application or for any transaction you may enter into with the provider of any such Third Party Applications.</p>

<h2 id="6-user-generated-content">6. User-Generated Content</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
You keep complete ownership of all content, but give us permission to use it on Chorale. Make sure you have permission to use content that you post on Chorale. You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post. Chorale is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content.

</div>


<p>Chorale users may post, upload, and/or contribute (“post”) content to the Service (which may include, for example, pictures, text, messages, information, playlist compilations, and/or other types of content) (“User Content”). For the avoidance of doubt, “User Content” includes any such content posted to any part of the Chorale Service.</p>

<p>You promise that, with respect to any User Content you post on Chorale, (1) you have the right to post such User Content, and (2) such User Content, or its use by Chorale as contemplated by the Agreements, does not violate the Agreements, applicable law, or the intellectual property (including without limitation copyright), publicity, personality, or other rights of others or imply any affiliation with or endorsement of you or your User Content by Chorale or any artist, band, label, entity or individual without express written consent from such individual or entity.</p>

<p>Chorale may, but has no obligation to, monitor, review, or edit User Content. In all cases, Chorale reserves the right to remove or disable access to any User Content for any or no reason, including but not limited to, User Content that, in Chorale’s sole discretion, violates the Agreements. Chorale may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party. Removal or disabling of access to User Content shall be at our sole discretion, and we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content.</p>

<p>You are solely responsible for all User Content that you post. Chorale is not responsible for User Content nor does it endorse any opinion contained in any User Content. YOU AGREE THAT IF ANYONE BRINGS A CLAIM AGAINST CHORALE RELATED TO USER CONTENT THAT YOU POST, THEN, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LOCAL LAW, YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD CHORALE HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND EXPENSES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS) ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIM.</p>

<h2 id="7-rights-you-grant-us">7. Rights You Grant Us</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
  We get to keep your feedback and use the information you provide us to give better service.

</div>


<p>In consideration for the rights granted to you under the Agreements, you grant us the right (1) to allow the Chorale Service to use the processor, bandwidth, and storage hardware on your Device in order to facilitate the operation of the Service, (2) to provide advertising and other information to you. In any part of the Chorale Service, the Content you view, including its selection and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including agreements with third parties. Some Content licensed or provided to Chorale (e.g. podcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content. In such cases, Chorale will make such Content available to you unmodified.</p>

<p>If you provide feedback, ideas or suggestions to Chorale in connection with the Chorale Service or Content (“Feedback”), you acknowledge that the Feedback is not confidential and you authorize Chorale to use that Feedback without restriction and without payment to you. Feedback is considered a type of User Content.</p>

<p>You grant Chorale a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, perpetual (or, in jurisdictions where this is not permitted, for a term equal to the duration of the Agreements plus twenty (20) years), irrevocable, fully paid, worldwide licence to use, reproduce, make available to the public (e.g. perform or display), publish, translate, modify, create derivative works from, and distribute any of your User Content in connection with the Service through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created. Aside from the rights specifically granted herein, you retain ownership of all rights, including intellectual property rights, in the User Content. Where applicable and permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive any “moral rights” (or the equivalent under applicable law) such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content, including Feedback, and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.</p>

<p>Chorale respects intellectual property rights and expects its users to do the same. If you are a copyright holder, or its agent, and you believe that any of the copyrighted material which is directly available via the Chorale Service infringes your copyrighted work, please let us know by <a href="/contact">contacting us</a>.</p>

<p>A notification of alleged copyright infringement must be addressed to Chorale&rsquo;s staff as listed above. Please include as much detail as possible to allow us to identify the facts or circumstances, including, where possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>A physical or electronic signature of the owner (or person authorized to act on behalf of the owner) of the copyright that is allegedly infringed;</li>
<li>Specific identification of each copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed;</li>
<li>A description of where the material believed to be infringing is located on Chorale Service or the Chorale Websites (please be as detailed as possible and provide a URL to help us locate the material you are reporting);</li>
<li>Contact information for the complaining party, such as a complete name, address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
<li>A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the work(s) in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and</li>
<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and that the complaining party is the owner of the right that is allegedly infringed, or agent for the owner.</li>
</ul>

<p>We should also let you know that Chorale has a policy to terminate in appropriate circumstances the accounts of subscribers who are repeat infringers.</p>

<p>If Chorale is notified by a copyright holder that any Content infringes a copyright, Chorale may in its absolute discretion take actions without prior notification to the provider of that Content. If the provider believes that the content is not infringing, the provider may submit a counter-notification to Chorale with a request to restore the removed content.</p>

<p>If you believe that any Content does not comply with the User Guidelines, please contact us.</p>

<h2 id="10-service-limitations-modifications">10. Service Limitations &amp; Modifications</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
Stuff with our app can happen. We will obviously try to keep it up at 100%, but make no guarantee of such uptime.

</div>


<p>Chorale will make reasonable efforts to keep the Chorale Service operational. However, certain technical difficulties or maintenance may, from time to time, result in temporary interruptions. To the extent permissible under applicable law, Chorale reserves the right, periodically and at any time, to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, functions and features of the Chorale Service, with or without notice, all without liability to you, except where prohibited by law, for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Chorale Service or any function or feature thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have prepaid fees for Paid Subscriptions that Chorale permanently discontinues prior to the end of the Pre-Paid Period (defined in the Payments, cancellations, and cooling off section), Chorale will refund you the prepaid fees for the Pre-Paid Period after such discontinuation. You understand, agree, and accept that Chorale has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Service, or to provide all or any specific content through the Service. This section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law. Chorale and/or the owners of any Content may, from time to time, remove any such Content without notice to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

<h2 id="13-customer-support">13. Customer Support</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
 We will use reasonable endeavours to respond to all Customer Support Queries within a reasonable time frame.

</div>


<p>For customer support with account-related and payment-related questions (“Customer Support Queries”), please contact us from our website. We will use reasonable endeavours to respond to all Customer Support Queries within a reasonable time frame but we make no guarantees or warranties of any kind that any Customer Support Queries will be responded to within any particular time frame and/or that we will be able to satisfactorily answer any such queries.</p>

<h2 id="14-payments-cancellations-and-the-cooling-off-period">14. Payments, Cancellations, and the Cooling-Off Period</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
This section covers payments, cancellations, and the European Cooling Off period. This is yet another important section in this agreement.

</div>


<p>Paid Subscriptions can be purchased directly from Chorale or through a third party.</p>

<p>When you register for a Paid Subscription or Trial online, you consent to get access to the aforementioned Paid Subscription immediately. If you reside outside the United States and register for a Paid Subscription or Trial online, you may change your mind for any or no reason and receive a full refund of all monies paid within fourteen (14) days starting from the day you sign-up for the relevant service (the “Cooling-off Period”). Refunds will not, however, be provided if you have accessed Chorale at any time during the Cooling-off Period.</p>

<p>Your payment to Chorale will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period, unless you cancel your Paid Subscription through your subscription page before the end of the current subscription period. The cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period, and you will be downgraded to the Free Service. However, if you cancel your payment or Paid Subscription and/or terminate any of the Agreements (1) after you have accessed Chorale during the Cooling-off Period, or (2) after the Cooling-off Period is over (where applicable), or (3) before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us. The refund method will depend upon the payment method.</p>

<p>If you wish to receive a full refund of all monies paid before the Cooling-off Period is over, you must contact us.</p>

<p>If you have purchased your Paid Subscription through a third party, your subscription is also subject to the terms of your agreement with that third party (in addition to these Terms). To cancel your subscription, you must cancel directly with that third party.</p>

<p>Chorale may change the price for the Paid Subscriptions, Pre-Paid Period (for periods not yet paid for) from time to time, and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Chorale Service after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the Chorale Service prior to the price change going into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.</p>

<h2 id="15-term-and-termination">15. Term and Termination</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
This section covers termination of agreement or membership.

</div>


<p>The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or Chorale. However, you acknowledge and agree that the perpetual licence granted by you in relation to User Content, including Feedback, is irrevocable and will therefore continue after expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason. Chorale may terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the Chorale Service at any time, including in the event of your actual or suspected unauthorised use of the Chorale Service and/or Content, or non-compliance with the Agreements. If you or Chorale terminate the Agreements, or if Chorale suspends your access to the Chorale Service, you agree that Chorale shall have no liability or responsibility to you and Chorale will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. To learn how to terminate your Chorale account, please contact us. This section will be enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law. You may terminate the Agreements at any time.
==TODO==
Sections 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 herein, as well as any other sections of the Agreements that, either explicitly or by their nature, must remain in effect even after termination of the Agreements, shall survive termination.</p>

TL;DR: YOU AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY PROBLEMS OR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE CHORALE SERVICE IS TO UNINSTALL ANY CHORALE SOFTWARE AND TO STOP USING THE CHORALE SERVICE.

</div>


<p>YOU AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY PROBLEMS OR DISSATISFACTION WITH THE CHORALE SERVICE IS TO UNINSTALL ANY CHORALE SOFTWARE AND TO STOP USING THE CHORALE SERVICE. WHILE CHORALE ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS OR THE CONTENT THEREOF, AND WHILE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SUCH THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS MAY BE GOVERNED BY SEPARATE AGREEMENTS WITH SUCH THIRD PARTIES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AS WITH RESPECT TO CHORALE, FOR ANY PROBLEMS OR DISSATISFACTION WITH THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS OR THE CONTENT THEREOF, IS TO UNINSTALL AND/OR STOP USING ANY SUCH THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS.</p>

<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL CHORALE, ITS OFFICERS, SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS, ASSIGNS, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR (1) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (2) ANY LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS (WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT), IN ALL CASES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE CHORALE SERVICE, THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS, OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER CHORALE HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE; OR (3) AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE CHORALE SERVICE, THIRD PARTY APPLICATIONS, OR THIRD PARTY APPLICATION CONTENT MORE THAN THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO CHORALE DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS IN QUESTION, TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

<p>Nothing in the Agreements removes or limits Chorale’s liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, death or personal injury caused by its negligence, and, if required by applicable law, gross negligence. Some aspects of this section may not apply in some jurisdictions if prohibited by applicable law.</p>

<h2 id="18-third-party-rights">18. Third Party Rights</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
You acknowledge and agree that the owners of the Content and certain distributors (such as app store providers) are intended beneficiaries of the Agreements and have the right to enforce the Agreements directly against you.

</div>


<p>You acknowledge and agree that the owners of the Content and certain distributors (such as app store providers) are intended beneficiaries of the Agreements and have the right to enforce the Agreements directly against you. Other than as set out in this section, the Agreements are not intended to grant rights to anyone except you and Chorale, and in no event shall the Agreements create any third party beneficiary rights. Furthermore, the rights to terminate, rescind, or agree to any variation, waiver, or settlement of the Agreements are not subject to the consent of any other person.</p>

<p>If you have downloaded the App from the Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) App Store or if you are using the App on an iOS device, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the following notice regarding Apple. This Agreement is between you and Chorale only, not with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Service and the content thereof. Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Service. In the event of any failure of the Service to conform to any applicable warranty, then you may notify Apple and Apple will refund any applicable purchase price for the App to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Service. Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Service or your possession and/or use of the Service, including, but not limited to: (1) product liability claims; (2) any claim that the Service fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (3) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any third party claim that the Service and/or your possession and use of the App infringe that third party’s intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third party terms, when using the Service. Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement. You hereby represent and warrant that (1) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (2) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>

<h2 id="19-entire-agreement">19. Entire agreement</h2>

If you breach this agreement, or violate any law or the rights of a third party, then you agree to indemnify and hold Chorale harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs).

</div>


<p>Other than as stated in this section or as explicitly agreed upon in writing between you and Chorale, the Agreements constitute all the terms and conditions agreed upon between you and Chorale and supersede any prior agreements in relation to the subject matter of these Agreements, whether written or oral.</p>

<p>Please note, however, that other aspects of your use of the Chorale Service may be governed by additional agreements. That could include, for example, access to the Chorale Service as a result of a gift card or free or discounted Trials. When you are presented with an offer for such aspects of your use, you will be presented with any related additional agreement, and you may have an opportunity to agree to additional terms. Some of those additional terms are listed on Chorale’s website. To the extent that there is any irreconcilable conflict between any additional terms and these Terms, the additional terms shall prevail.</p>

<h2 id="20-severability-waiver">20. Severability &amp; Waiver</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
According to Wikipedia, “Severability. In law, severability (sometimes known as salvatorius, from Latin) refers to a provision in a contract which states that if parts of the contract are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the remainder of the contract should still apply.”

</div>


<p>Unless as otherwise stated in the Agreements, should any provision of the Agreements be held invalid or unenforceable for any reason or to any extent, such invalidity or enforceability shall not in any manner affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreements, and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.</p>

<p>Any failure by Chorale or any third party beneficiary to enforce the Agreements or any provision thereof shall not waive Chorale’s or the applicable third party beneficiary’s right to do so.</p>

<h2 id="21-assignment">21. Assignment</h2>

<p>Chorale may assign the Agreements or any part of them, and Chorale may delegate any of its obligations under the Agreements. You may not assign the Agreements or any part of them, nor transfer or sub-license your rights under the Agreements, to any third party.</p>

<h2 id="22-indemnification">22. Indemnification</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
If we are sued because of you, you have to help pay for it. You agree to indemnify and hold Chorale harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs).

</div>


<p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold Chorale harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable attorney fees and costs) arising out of: (1) your breach of this Agreement; (2) any User Content; (3) any activity in which you engage on or through the Chorale Service; and (4) your violation of any law or the rights of a third party.</p>

privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that Chorale shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services.</p>

<h2 id="24-governing-law">24. Governing Law</h2>

<div class="container highlighted-bg">
  
A “Governing Law” clause is a clause used in legal agreements where you can declare which rules and laws will govern the agreement if legal issues arise. In our case, any disputes with us must be resolved in Lithuania.

</div>


<p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Lithuania, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>
