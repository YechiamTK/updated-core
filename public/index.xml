      <title>Music progressing with no sound</title>
      <link>https://thecodesign.io/support/troubleshooting/no-sound/</link>

      <description>Pressed play and you see that the music is progressing but there is no sound? Check some things first!
Is this a Chorale issue? Are your speakers switched on? Are your headphones fully inserted? Is all of your audio hardware functioning properly? To test this, try playing from an alternative source or device. For example, YouTube!
This may just be a system issue, where Chorale is not responsible for anything.</description>

      <description>I am a code+design enthusiast; and I’m sure since you’re reading this, you’re one as well. I’m an avid reader as well, and for obvious reasons, I’m going to go ahead and assume you’re one too.
I’ve been reading articles on the internet for a decade now, and I know the annoyance one feels when the article they’re presented with, is just a place-holder with more than 70% of padding. The noise- is too much; is increasing.</description>
